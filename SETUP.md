Before running the code user must ensure that following directories are pre-built to print the output files in their desired locations.

parent directory-2d_UnsteadyVortexPanel
inside the parent directory, there are subdirectories
- src
- include
- output_files
  - vortex_shedding
  - pressure_file
  - gamma_vector_file
  - potential_file
  - a_matrix_file
  - b_vector_file
  - airfoil_normal_file

Since the problem is time dependent each of these directories will comprise of multiple files corresponding to each time step.
